# ivanakupala
People’s celebration of summer and sun is quite common across the nations of Europe. The holiday itself has many names — flakagajt (the day of fire) in Albania, Saint Jeans (St. Jean) in France, midsommar in Sweden, sobotka in Poland, Ivana Kupala in Ukraine, and more. The celebration of Ivan Kupala Day falls on June 24 (old 
style calendar) or July 7 (new style) and worships the summer solstice. In Ukraine, we traditionally celebrate it on the night of July 6-7 — all mysteries happen right then…

Introducing the Unity VR game, where players experience a celebration of Ukrainian culture while navigating disruptive behavior in a peaceful and entertaining manner. In this game, players have two options for handling the situation: using objects found in their environment to playfully "beat" the disruptor or offering gifts like flowers or traditional bread and salt to welcome them into the celebration.

With various activities such as jumping over fire, and searching for a mythical plant in the darkness of the night, players are immersed in the celebration's customs and traditions. 

Through Unity VR technology, players are transported into a world of vibrant colors, traditional music, and interactive gameplay, promoting unity and cultural appreciation. Join the celebration today and experience the best of Ukrainian culture!
